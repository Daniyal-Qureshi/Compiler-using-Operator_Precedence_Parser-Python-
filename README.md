Operator-Precedence-Parser
==========================

Python program for operator precedence parser. It analyzes the grammar given in "grammar.txt" and precedence of operators provided in "order.csv" and then validates the input string.

For an example "order.csv" contains left associative grammar for basic arithmetic operators. The "operator_precedence.py" anlyzes the grammar and precedence rules and reduces the string "i - i + i" where i represents id.
